## *What is Github?* 
At its heart, __GitHub is a collaboration platform.__
From software to legal documents, you can count on GitHub to help you do your best work with the collaboration and security tools your team needs. With GitHub, you can keep projects completely **private**, invite the world to **collaborate**, and **streamline** every step of your project.
GitHub is also a __powerful version control tool__.
GitHub uses **Git** 📖, the most popular open source version control software, to track every contribution and contributor 📖 to your project so you know exactly where every line of code came from.
GitHub helps people do much more.
GitHub is used to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you're visualizing data or building a new game, there's a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can get you to the next step. This course starts with the basics, but we'll dig into the rest later!
